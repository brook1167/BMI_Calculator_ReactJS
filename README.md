# BMI_Calculator_ReactJS

I have created a simple website using Vite + React that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The website has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to enter their height and weight. Upon submission, the website calculates the BMI and return theri result.
